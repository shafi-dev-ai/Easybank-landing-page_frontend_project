## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to create a landing page for Easybank, a modern bank promoting digital banking methods. Users should be able to-

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shafi-dev-ai/Easybank-landing-page_frontend_project.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project demands a good knowledge about CSS to execute the landing page as be as accurate relative to the design as possible. Knowledge about hover states executed as-

```
.nav-link:hover {
    background-size: 100% 4px, auto;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

or knowledge about different states of same element on occurence of events-

```
#menu-toggle:checked+.menu-button-container .menu-button::before {
    margin-top: 0px;
    transform: rotate(405deg);
}

#menu-toggle:checked+.menu-button-container .menu-button {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);
}

#menu-toggle:checked+.menu-button-container .menu-button::after {
    margin-top: 0px;
    transform: rotate(-405deg);
```

is crucial to make this project work.

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of.

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
